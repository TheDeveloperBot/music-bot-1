# Potatobot
My Discord music bot based off of meew0's Lethe and chalda's DiscordBot and made possible by hydrabolt's [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js).

**Warning:** This bot is built on the unofficial Discord API and using experimental features and will probably break in the future.

## Requirements
+ node.js

If using Windows:
+ Visual Studio 2015 (Express, Community, or Enteprise)
+ Python 2.7

## Installation
From what I've seen, the easiest way to get your bot up and running is by using a linux workspace in a cloud.
I used [Cloud9] (https://c9.io) to develop and run my bot.


If using windows, make sure to install node-opus before everything else.
```
$ npm install node-opus
```
And [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).

For Linux(if you dont already have it) or c9:

```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/trusty-media
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

Then install all the modules
```
$ npm install discord.js
$ npm install superagent
$ npm install url
$ npm install ytdl-core
```

## Usage
Make sure to create config.json and rss.json by using the example files
```
$ node musicbot.js
```
